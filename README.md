I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ trying to find a balance between building some dope and engineering. I do build things for the web by day and get immersed in Rust programming by night.

-  Research-wise, I'm interested in enhancing performance, memory safety, concurrency, etc of system using Rust and computer vision (large multimodal models, generative models, etc.).
-  I'm learning to build decentralized applications (dApps) using Rust and blockchain technology for secure and efficient smart contracts.
-  My personal website is [mxnish.me](https://mxnish.me). It's simple and serious, much like those of other fellowmates.
-  Currently interested in building things in *Minecraft*.
-  Goal : `while(sleeping){money++;}`
